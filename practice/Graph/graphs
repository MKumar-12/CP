Djkstra's vs Prim's 

    in Djkstra, while standing at any node, 
        we usually notice the dist. to reach its neighbour as
        the sum of dist. reqd. from starting at SOURCE to neighbour

whereas, 
    in Prim, while standing at any point, 
        we look for the min. outgoing costs to its neighbour
        the best/lowest shortest length for reaching to neighbour nodes is noticed.
