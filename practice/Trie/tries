    ^ Hashmap can be used, i.e., O(1) T.C. for all operations in Avg. Case
        <string, bool>  

But it can be O(length) in Worst case for a string with length l.


Structure of TRIE:
class TrieNode {
    public :
        char data;
        TrieNode* children[26];
        bool isTerminal;
}


Working of Trie :
INSERTION/ SEARCHING
                take 1st char from str., 
                search if it exists from the nodes connected to root
                    If it exists, follow the path,
                    else create a new node n then proceed.
                ^ until str. is traversed completely.

(Every node can have upto 26 childs)

Terminal node : Last char. of each str.
{Every path in Trie denotes an individual str.}
