Djkstra's algo.
It is a Greedy algo
Single source shortest path
For finding shortest path from a given node to final node in a 
WEIGHTED GRAPH.

non-weighted graph  :   vector<int> g[N];
weighted graph      :   vector< pair<int,int> > g[N];  

Path
a sequence of nodes in which each node is visited exactly only once.
[start n end vertex must be different]

Graph can be represented using
Adj. matrix      T.C.  O(n*m)
    using arr/vector

Adj. list        T.C.  O(n logm)
    using vector/map

    map<int,list<int>>;
    or  vector<vector<int>>;
